        You’ve been a Happy Melly member since @date(member.since). (That’s at least @length days of happiness)
        Big respect to you!

        In about two weeks your Happy Melly membership will automatically renew for another year.
        (We’ll send you a confirmation receipt once your payment method on file has been charged.)
    }
    @mail.hm.html.paragraph {
        If you need to update your payment details before renewal takes place, you can
        <a href="@profileUrl#membership">update</a> them via your Teller Account.
    }
    @mail.hm.html.paragraph {
        You might check your Teller <a href="@profileUrl">profile</a>
        to make sure your social info, website links, etc. are all up to date. And hey, while you’re there, maybe
        grab a Happy Melly badge for your website, if you haven’t already!

        If you’ve enjoyed the Happy Melly community as much as we’ve enjoyed having you a part of it, can we ask you to
        share a smile or two? Here are a few links you can “click to tweet”
    }

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://ctt.ec/aRFxP">Happiness is the future of work. #happinessatwork http://ctt.ec/aRFxP+</a></li>

        PS: If for any reason you don’t wish to renew your Happy Melly membership,
        <a href="@profileUrl#membership">here’s a link</a> to your Teller profile account page to cancel. We’d be sad
        to see you go, and we would like to know what we could have done better to support your mission.
        Please reach out and <a href="http://www.happymelly.com/contact/">let us know</a>.
