        Something wasn’t quite right when we attempted to automatically renew your Happy Melly membership.
        It seems like your payment method might need updating.

        To maintain your Happy Melly membership, you must update your credit card details via
        <a href="@profileUrl#membership">your Teller Account</a> before @date(expire).
    }
    @mail.hm.html.paragraph {
        In the event you don’t wish to renew your membership, you don’t have to do anything. But we’d really appreciate
        <a href="http://www.happymelly.com/contact/">a quick email</a>, or Slack message to let us know why you’ve
        chosen not to continue.
