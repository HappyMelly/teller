<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>All API requests require authentication using a application-specific token.
  To get a token, please contact <a href="mailto:sergey.kotlov@@happymelly.com">Sergey Kotlov</a>.</p>
<p>There are two supported types of applications: read-only and read-write. Make sure
  you mention which type of application you want to write.</p>

<h3> Markdown and XSS attacks</h3>

<p>Certain fields in this API contain content formatted in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.
  Markdown is a plain-text mark-up language, used for generating HTML, that may also contain HTML tags. A web page
  that embeds HTML generated from user-entered Markdown is at risk of
  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)">XSS attacks</a>, a significant security risk.
  However, the risk is low for this application, because malicious users are less likely than for public applications.</p>

<p>Any HTML tags in a piece of Markdown will end up in the HTML output verbatim. This means that it is possible to put <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags
  inside Markdown content, and have any JavaScript code run on any page that embeds that output. For
  <a href="http://michelf.ca/blog/2010/markdown-and-xss/">various technical reasons</a>, it is not possible to
  sanitize Markdown input to guard against this. Therefore, <strong>all HTML <em>output</em> generated by
    Markdown processors <em>must</em> be sanitized.</strong> There are various libraries available to help you clean
  HTML output. For example, there's <a href="http://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/whitelist-sanitizer">jsoup</a>
  for Java, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kses/">kses</a> for PHP, and
  <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize">Sanitize</a> for Ruby.</p>
