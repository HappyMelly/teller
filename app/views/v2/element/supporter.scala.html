<p>If you value the purpose of Happy Melly (pursuing happy work-lives) then you can now join us as a Member. This means
    you help us promote happiness in work. You can then proudly wear the Happy Melly badge on your blog or website, and
    you can say you are officially a member of the Professional Happiness Association. Oh, and you will enjoy some
    benefits too, such as exclusive access to people, content and events.</p>
<p>But who cares about benefits!? This is not about what's-in-it-for-me, it's about what's-in-it-for-them! Your support
    is going to help us sponsor the best events, produce the best books, and offer the best content, for all those
    unhappy Mellys who still hate their jobs.</p>
