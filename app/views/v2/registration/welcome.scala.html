            <p>If you value the purpose of Happy Melly (pursuing happy work-lives)
                then you can now join us as a Supporter. This means you <b>help us
                promote happiness in work</b>. You can then proudly wear the Happy
                Melly badge on your blog or website, and you can say you are
                <em>officially</em> a member of the network. Oh, and you will enjoy
                some benefits too, such as exclusive access to people, content and events.</p>
            <p>But who cares about benefits!? This is not about <em>what's-in-it-for-me</em>,
                it's about <em>what's-in-it-for-them</em>! Your support is going to
                help us sponsor the best events, produce the best books, and offer
                the best content, for all those unhappy Mellys who still hate their jobs.</p>
